* =emacs-org-dnd=

Provides an org-mode compatability layer to the
[[https://github.com/ashonit/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template][D&D 5e LaTeX
Template]].

* News

See [[file:CHANGELOG.org]].

* Installation

As much effort as possible has been taken to make creation feel like natural
org-mode markup.

Follow the instructions to set up the package at the
[[https://github.com/evanbergeron/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template][LaTeX template repo]].

Clone this repo somewhere and add it to your emacs load path.

Add the following to your =.emacs=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-dnd)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Simply add the following to your =.org= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
    ,#+LATEX_CLASS: dndbook
#+END_SRC

Each environment in the LaTeX package corresponds to an org-mode block. Each
block is customised using (several) attributes.

=ox-dnd= provides an org-mode export backend. You can export the buffer as
a PDF file with @@html:<kbd>@@ <C-c> <C-e> l d @@html:</kbd>@@ (invoking
the org-mode export dispatcher, then =l d=).

Options are included here. For full usage examples, see
[[file:example/example.org][the example document]]. A sample PDF and tex
output is included in the [[./example][example]] folder.

** Additional options

Package options can be specified in the standard =#+OPTIONS= header. The
following options are added or changed from their default LaTeX export values:

- =:title= :: Boolean. Disabled by default, as of upstream version 0.7.0 there
  is no official styled title.
- =:justified= :: Boolean. Justify column copy (default =t=).
- =:layout= :: Boolean. Controls whether loading the =dnd= LaTeX package also
  modifies the document layout (default =t=). Has no effect if
  =org-dnd-use-package= is =nil=.
- =:bg= :: String value. Declare how to load background and footer images:
  - =full= :: Load both the background and footer images (default).
  - =none= :: Remove both the background and footer images.
  - =print= :: Load only the footer images.
- =:no-multitoc= :: Boolean. Don't use the multi-column table of contents (default =f=).
- =:high-contrast= :: Boolean. Use the high-contrast mode of the template (default =f=).

** Customisation

If you prefer to use the package in your exported file rather than the class
(the recommended option), you can set =org-dnd-use-package= in your =.emacs=
before loading this package:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-dnd-use-package t)
  (require 'ox-dnd)
#+end_src

** Comment/paper/quote box

- =NAME= :: Title of box

** Subtitle

No attributes.

Heading on first line of block, subtitle on second line of block.

** Spell

- =NAME= :: Name of spell
- =ATTR_SPELL= :: Spell information:
  - =:level= :: Spell level
  - =:school= :: Spell school (illusion, abjuration, etc.)
  - =:range= :: Spell range (include unit; e.g., =5 feet=)
  - =:cast= :: Cast time (include unit; e.g., =1 action=)
  - =:duration= :: Spell duration (include unit; e.g., =Until dispelled=,
    =1 round/level=)
  - =:comp= :: Spell components (in full, including information for
    material components)

    Block contents are the spell description.

** Monster

- =NAME= :: Name of monster
- =ATTR_MONSTER_INFO= :: Content in the subheader of a monster:
  - =:size=
  - =:race=
  - =:subrace=; optional
  - =:alignment=
- =ATTR_MONSTER_BASICS= :: Basic stat block; all optional:
  - =:ac= (armor class)
  - =:hp= (hit dice; given as dice notation, e.g., 3d8+3)
  - =:speed=; for ground speed. For other types of speed, additionally use
    =:fly=, =:burrow=, =:climb=, =:swim=, or =:hover=
- =ATTR_MONSTER_STATS= :: Monster stats; modifiers are calculated
  automatically; all optional:
  - =:con=
  - =:str=
  - =:dex=
  - =:int=
  - =:wis=
  - =:cha=
- =ATTR_MONSTER_DETAILS= :: Detailed information; all optional:
  - =:skills=
  - =:saves=
  - =:cim= (condition immunities)
  - =:imm= (damage immunities)
  - =:res= (damage resistances)
  - =:vul= (damage vulnerabilities)
  - =:senses= (e.g., darkvision, tremorsense)
  - =:langs= (languages)
  - =:cr= (challenge rating; experience value calculated automatically)


Block contents are the monster skills in the following format:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
     - Skill name :: Effect
     - Actions
       - Action name :: Effect
     - Legendary Actions
       - Legendary action name :: Effect
#+END_SRC

Any entry that appears before the actions header is a passive skill. The blurb
for legendary actions is added automatically. Any number of entries in each
category (skill, action, legendary action) can be added.

** Tables

Tables are formatted the same as regular org-mode tables.

=NAME= is used only internally (i.e., for referencing). To set a visible
title for a table, use =HEADER=.

Tables with no =CAPTION= are formatted inline with text and allow wrapping.
Texts with a caption span both columns.

Tables accept the following attributes through =ATTR_DND=:

- =:align= :: As with the standard org-mode align attribute, accepts a LaTeX
  alignment string. Common are =lX= or =cX= to left- or centre-align the left
  column and expand the right column to fill the page column.
- =:color= :: Accepts a color as defined by the LaTeX package. See the
  example document for a list of valid colors.

** Map sections

Map sections are automatically from any heading with the =:map:= tag. The
=:map:= tag will not be rendered as tags normally are. Area sections have two
levels (=area= and =subarea=), so any deeper than two nested levels is not
supported.

NOTE: Things may break in the section if a top-level heading (rather than a
level 2 heading as in the example) is tagged as a map. There should probably be
a fix eventually for this.
